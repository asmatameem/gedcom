=== 0.9.1 / 2012-19-27

* transcription of code from original C source base.
* Bug fix to GEDCOMBase.xref_check, which didn't qualify index lookup when printing an error message.
* Added Transmission.self_check, which calls new FamilyRecord.self_check and IndividualRecord.self_check
  Checks the gedcom file FAMC, FAMS, HUSB, WIFE, CHIL and SUBM xrefs resolve to valid records.
  Required adding IndividualRecord.child? and IndividualRecord.spouse? for tests.
  Fixed bug in IndividualRecord.spouses and IndividualRecord.parents_family as neither worked and were used by tests.
