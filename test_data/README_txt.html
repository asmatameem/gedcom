CONTENTS OF TEST GEDCOM
ARCHIVE-------------------------------------------------------------------The
four 100%-valid GEDCOM files in this packet are:1. TGC55.ged2.
TGC55CLF.ged3. TGC551.ged4. TGC551LF.gedThe first two files are
identical except the first one ends lines in a single carriage return while
the second one ends lines in a carriage return and a line feed. Both
formats are allowed by GEDCOM, but some genealogy applications require the
line feeds.The second two files are identical to the first two except
that the "Joseph Tag Torture" record has only one NAME structure (hence the
"1" in the names). According to GEDCOM, multiple name structures are
allowed in individual records, but very few programs will recognize the
second name. The extra files are provided because some programs actually
get corrupted results (sometimes including crashes) when a second name
structure occurs. You can try these files instead if you have unexpected
problems with the first two files.The remaining files are multimedia
files and various other types of files. All of these files are linked to
one or more records in the GEDCOM files using GEDCOM OBJE file links. The
files are here to see if genealogy applications preserve such file
links.-------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES ON THE TEST
FILE-------------------------------------------------------------------The
following notes can be found in the header record (HEAD) of each file. You
can read the notes in there. Unfortunately, very few genealogy applications
actually import the header and thus most will simply discard all these
notes. You can read them here if the software does not import header
data.-------------------------------------------------------------------
HEADER RECORD
NOTES-------------------------------------------------------------------This
file demonstrates all tags that are allowed in GEDCOM 5.5. Here are some
comments about the HEADER record and comments about where to look for
information on the other 9 types of GEDCOM records. Most other records will
have their own notes that describe what to look for in that record and what
to hope the importing software will find.Many applications will fail to
import these notes. The notes are therefore also provided with the files as
a plain-text "Read-Me" file.--------------------------The HEADER
Record:     This record has all possible tags for a HEADER record. In uses
one custom tag ("_HME") to see what the software will say about custom
tags.--------------------------INDIVIDUAL Records:     This file has a
small number of INDIVIDUAL records. The record named "Joseph Tag Torture"
has all possible tags for an INDIVIDUAL record. All remaining  individuals
have less tags. Some test specific features; for example:     Name:
Standard GEDCOM Filelinks     Name: Nonstandard Multimedia Filelinks    
Name: General Custom Filelinks     Name: Extra URL Filelinks         
These records link to multimedia files mentioned by the GEDCOM standard and
to a variety of other types of multimedia files, general files, or URL
names.     Name: Chris Locked Torture          Has a "locked"
restriction (RESN) tag - should not be able to edit this record it. This
record has one set of notes that is used to test line breaking in notes and
a few other text-parsing features of the GEDCOM software. Read those notes
to see what they are testing.     Name: Sandy Privacy Torture         
Has a "privacy" restriction (RESN) tag. Is the tag recognized and how is
the record displayed and/or printed?     Name: Chris Locked Torture    
Name: Sandy Privacy Torture     Name: Pat Smith Torture          The
three children in this file have unknown sex (no SEX tag). An ancestor tree
from each should give five generations of ancestors.     Name: Charlie
Accented ANSEL     Name: Lucy Special ANSEL          The notes in these
records use all possible special characters in the ANSEL character set. The
header of this file denotes this file as using the ANSEL character set. The
importing software should handle these special characters in a reasonable
way.     Name: Torture GEDCOM Matriarch           All individuals in
this file are related and all are descendants (or spouses of descendants)
of Torture GEDCOM Matriarch. A descendant tree or report from this
individual should show five generations of
descendants.--------------------------FAMILY Records:     The FAMILY
record for "Joseph Tag Torture" (husband) and "Mary First Jones" (wife) has
all tags allowed in family records. All other family records use only a few
tags and are used to provide records for extra family links in other
records.--------------------------SOURCE Records:     There are two
SOURCE records in this file. The "Everything You Every Wanted to Know about
GEDCOM Tags" source has all possible GEDCOM tags for a SOURCE record. The
other source only has only a few
tags.--------------------------REPOSITORY Record:     There is just one
REPOSITORY record and it uses all possible tags for such a
record.--------------------------SUBMITTER Records:     This file has
three SUBMITTER records. The "John A. Nairn" record has all tags allowed in
such records. The second and third submitter are to test how programs input
files with multiple submitters. The GEDCOM standard does not allow for
notes in SUBMITTER records. Look in the "Main Submitter" to verify all
address data comes through, that all three phone numbers appear, and that
the multimedia file link is
preserved.--------------------------MULTIMEDIA OBJECT Record:     The
one MULTIMEDIA record has all possible tags and even has encoded data for a
small image of a flower. There are no known GEDCOM programs that can read
or write such records. The record is included here to test how programs
might respond to finding multimedia records present. There are possible
plans to eliminate encoded multimedia objects in the next version of
GEDCOM. In the future all multimedia will be included by links to other
files. To test current file links and extended file links, see the
"Filelinks" family records described
above.--------------------------SUBMISSION Record:     The one (maximum
allowed) SUBMISSION record in this file has all possible tags for such a
record.--------------------------NOTE Records:     This file has many
NOTE records. These are all linked to other
records.--------------------------TRLR Records:     This file ends in
the standard TRLR record.--------------------------ADDITIONAL NOTES    
This file was originally created by H. Eichmann at
&lt;h.eichmann@@mbox.iqo.uni-hannover.de&gt; and posted on the
Internet.(NOTE: email addresses are listed here with double "at" signs. A
rule of GEDCOM parsing is that these should be converted to single "at" at
signs, but not many programs follow that rule. In addition, that rule is
not needed and may be abandoned in a future version of GEDCOM).This
original file was extensively modified by J. A. Nairn using GEDitCOM 2.9.4
(1999-2001) at &lt;support@@geditcom.com&gt; and posted on the Internet at
&lt;<a href="http://www.geditcom.com">www.geditcom.com</a>&gt;. Some
changes included many more notes, the use or more tags, extensive testing
of multimedia file links, and some notes to test all special ANSEL
characters.Feel free to copy and use this GEDCOM file for any 
non-commercial purpose.For selecting the allowed tags, the GEDCOM
standard Release 5.5 (2 JAN 1996) was used. Copyright: The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-Day Saints, &lt;gedcom@@gedcom.org&gt;.You can download
the GEDCOM 5.5 specs from: &lt;ftp.gedcom.com/pub/genealogy/gedcom&gt;. You
